## ⬇️ Downgrading Your Plan

Need fewer resources for now? You can downgrade to a lower plan — just be mindful of usage.

### 🧭 How Downgrades Work:

- Downgrades take effect **at the end of your current billing cycle**
- You must stay **within the limits** of the lower-tier plan (e.g., site count, storage)
- WC Studio may flag over-limit usage for review before applying the downgrade

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you only need more features temporarily, upgrading for 1 cycle is a smarter option than staying locked into a larger plan.
