# 🌍 Understanding Store Environments

In WC Studio, every store you create can run in different **environments** — giving you complete flexibility over how you build, test, and deploy your eCommerce experience.

---

## 📌 What is a Store Environment?

A **store environment** is a separate version of your store used for different purposes — such as development, testing, or production. WC Studio allows you to manage your store’s environments seamlessly without needing third-party tools.

## 🧩 Available Environment Types

### ✅ Live Environment
- This is your **customer-facing**, fully functional store.
- All orders, payments, and customer interactions happen here.
- Designed for **speed, security, and performance**.

### 🛠 Development Environment
- Used for **building or testing new features**, layouts, or code customizations.
- You can safely experiment without affecting your live store.
- Ideal for **developers or staging plugin/theme compatibility**.

### 🧪 Staging Environment
- A clone of your live store used for **pre-launch testing**.
- Helps verify updates, plugin changes, or content modifications before they go live.
- Supports **QA teams or last-minute reviews**.

## 🧭 Switching Between Environments

📍 Go to: `WC Studio → Dashboard → Environment Filter`

1. Use the **Environment Filter dropdown** at the top of your dashboard.
2. Select:
   - `Live`
   - `Staging`
   - `Development`

✅ The store list and statistics will update based on your selection.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Always test **major changes** (e.g., plugin updates, checkout changes) in a **Staging** environment first.
- Use **Development** for ongoing experiments, custom features, or plugin trials.
- Keep your **Live** environment clean, updated, and secure for the best customer experience.
