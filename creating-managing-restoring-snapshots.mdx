# 🧷 Taking, Managing & Restoring Snapshots

WC Studio Snapshots allow you to **save**, **restore**, and **reapply** your store’s exact state — including database, files, plugins, themes, and settings. Whether you’re testing, updating, or troubleshooting, snapshots give you instant control with zero risk.

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Snapshots

## 📸 Taking a Snapshot

Before making major changes, take a snapshot to preserve your current store state.

### ✅ Steps to Take a Snapshot

1. Go to the **Snapshots** panel.
2. Click **“Create Snapshot”**.
3. Give your snapshot a **name** (e.g. `Before Plugin Update`, `Launch-Ready`).
4. Add an optional **description**.
5. Click **Create Snapshot**.

📦 WC Studio will package your entire store environment, including:
- Files & folders
- Database
- PHP & WP settings
- Plugin/theme status
- Environment configuration

## 📂 Managing Snapshots

All your snapshots will appear in a list under the Snapshots dashboard.

| Column       | Description                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Snapshot Name** | The custom name you assigned           |
| **Created On**    | Date & time the snapshot was taken     |
| **Size**          | Total size of the snapshot package     |
| **Status**        | Success / In-Progress / Failed         |
| **Actions**       | Restore / Clone / Delete               |

### 🛠 Snapshot Actions

- **Restore**: Instantly roll your store back to this point.
- **Clone**: Use this snapshot to launch a new identical store.
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the snapshot from your archive.

> 🧠 Snapshots are isolated per store, but can be reused across stores with the **Clone** option.

## ♻️ Restoring a Snapshot

Restoring will **replace your current store state** with the saved snapshot.

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- The restore process is **instant and irreversible**.
- Always take a snapshot of the current state **before restoring**.
- It includes both **database and file changes**.
