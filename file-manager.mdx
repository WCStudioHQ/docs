# 🗂️ File Manager

The **File Manager** in WC Studio gives you direct access to your store’s file system — allowing you to create, upload, and manage files and folders without needing FTP or SSH access.

Use it to organize your project structure, upload media or scripts, and make code-level adjustments in a secure and user-friendly interface.
