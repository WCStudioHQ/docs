# 🛠️ Creating & Managing Configurations

WC Studio lets you create reusable **Configurations** — custom setup profiles that include themes, plugins, PHP settings, and more. These are perfect for speeding up new store creation and maintaining consistency across projects.

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Configurations

## ➕ Creating a New Configuration

You can create a configuration by capturing the current setup of an existing store.

### ✅ Steps to Create:

1. Navigate to **Configurations**
2. Click **“Add Configuration”**
3. Choose an existing store to base your configuration on
4. Name your configuration (e.g. “Fashion Starter Stack”)
5. (Optional) Add a description for clarity
6. Click **Save Configuration**

Your new configuration will now appear in your configuration library.

## 🧩 What’s Included

When creating a configuration, WC Studio captures:

- ✅ Active Theme
- ✅ Installed Plugins
- ✅ PHP Settings (e.g. memory limit, execution time)
- ✅ WordPress/WooCommerce base settings
- ✅ Environment configuration (Live, Staging, Dev)

> 💡 Customizations not stored in the plugin or theme database (e.g. media files, content) will not be included.

## 📥 Applying a Configuration

You can use saved configurations during new store creation:

1. Go to **Create New Store**
2. Choose **“Create From a Configuration”**
3. Select one of your saved profiles
4. WC Studio will auto-install the selected theme, plugins, and settings

This makes it incredibly easy to launch niche-specific or client-ready stores in minutes.
