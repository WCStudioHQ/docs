# 👥 Understanding Team Collaboration in WC Studio

Collaboration in WC Studio is built for teams — whether you're working with developers, designers, marketers, or clients. You can securely invite collaborators, assign roles, and manage permissions without giving away full admin access.

## 🧠 What Is Team Collaboration?

Team Collaboration allows you to:

- ✅ Invite team members or clients to specific stores
- ✅ Assign roles with limited or full access
- ✅ Monitor collaborator activity
- ✅ Delegate tasks like development, content, or management safely

---

## 🧾 Who Can You Invite?

Anyone with an email address can be added as a collaborator. Common use cases:

- 👨‍💻 Developers (manage plugins, themes, WP config)
- 🎨 Designers (customize appearance, upload assets)
- 📈 Marketers (access analytics, reports, content)
- 🤝 Clients (review store status without edit access)

## 🔐 Permission Levels

| Role         | Access Level                                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**    | Full access to everything: files, settings, billing, backups  |
| **Manager**  | Can manage store content, settings, themes, plugins           |
| **Developer**| Limited to technical settings: WP config, file manager, logs  |
| **Viewer**   | Read-only access to store dashboard and analytics             |

You can assign roles when inviting a user or update them later.
