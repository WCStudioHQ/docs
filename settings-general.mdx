## 🚧 Maintenance Mode

When enabled, your store will display a **maintenance page** to all visitors, while keeping admin access open.

### 🔧 Enable Maintenance Mode

- Toggle the setting to ON  
- Your live site will show a temporary maintenance screen  
- Useful during development, migration, or downtime

💡 **Pro Tip:** Always enable Maintenance Mode before launching major design or plugin changes.

---

## 🧪 Clone Store

Create a full duplicate of your existing store for **staging**, **testing**, or **server configuration experiments**.

### 🔁 Clone Store

- Click **Clone Store**
- A new store instance will be created with the same:
  - Files
  - Database
  - Themes & Plugins
  - Settings

You can choose to assign a new subdomain or environment label (e.g. `Staging` or `Dev`).

> 🔐 Cloned stores do **not affect your live store** — perfect for safe experimentation.

## 🗑️ Delete Store

Deleting a store is **permanent** and **cannot be undone**.

### ❌ Delete Store

- Click **Delete Store**
- Confirm the deletion
- All files, database content, and settings will be removed

⚠️ **Warning:** Use this only when you're absolutely sure. Always take a **Snapshot Backup** before deleting a site.
