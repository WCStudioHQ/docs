# 🗂️ Backups

WC Studio’s backup system helps you protect your store by regularly saving your files and databases. You can configure custom backup schedules and view/download previous snapshots — all without relying on external plugins or manual exports.

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Stores → Select a Store → Backups

Backups are available on **Business plans and above**. If you're on a lower-tier plan, you'll be prompted to **Upgrade Subscription** to enable this feature.
