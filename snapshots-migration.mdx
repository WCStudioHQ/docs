# 🚚 Using Snapshots for Store Migration

Need to move your store to a different domain, environment, or WC Studio instance? With **Snapshots**, migrating your store is simple, fast, and error-free. You can clone or restore a snapshot to launch an identical store on a new path without touching a single file manually.

## 🧭 When to Use Snapshots for Migration

## 🛠 Steps to Migrate a Store Using Snapshots

### Step 1: Take a Snapshot of the Source Store

1. Navigate to your existing store.
2. Go to **Snapshots**.
3. Click **“Take New Snapshot”**.
4. Name it (e.g. `Staging_March2025`) and click **Create**.

### Step 2: Clone Store from Snapshot

1. From the **Snapshots** panel, find the snapshot you created.
2. Click **Clone**.
3. Enter a new **Store Name** and **subdomain**.
4. Choose the **environment** (Live, Staging, Development).
5. Click **Create Store**.

✅ WC Studio will launch a brand-new store using the full state of the original store — including files, database, plugins, settings, and configuration.

## 🎯 What Gets Migrated?

- Add your new domain and set it as **Primary**
- Update any hardcoded URLs in content if needed (optional)
