# 📄 Logs

The **Logs** section in WC Studio provides access to **site-specific error logs**, allowing you to debug PHP errors, Laravel stack traces, cron failures, and more. This is your primary tool for identifying what went wrong when your store or custom features misbehave.

---

## 📍 Accessing Logs

**Go to:** `WC Studio → Stores → Select a Store → Advanced → Logs`

Each store has its own isolated logs for security, visibility, and clarity.

---

## 🧾 Log Format

Logs follow a standard format, which includes:

- Timestamp of the error
- Error level (e.g. `local.ERROR`)
- Error message
- Stack trace

## 🔍 Using the Logs Interface

- Logs are **automatically grouped by date**
- You can **search** by keywords (e.g., error type, class name)
- Click any log entry to **expand** and view the full trace
- Use **filters** to sort logs by severity: `error`, `warning`, `info`
