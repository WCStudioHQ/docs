# 🧷 Understanding Snapshots

**Snapshots** in WC Studio are full-point-in-time captures of your store — including files, database, themes, plugins, and settings. They let you roll back, restore, or replicate a store exactly as it was at the time the snapshot was taken.

Think of snapshots as ultra-powerful “save points” for your WooCommerce store.

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Snapshots

## 🧠 What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot captures your entire store’s environment, including:

- ✅ WordPress core
- ✅ WooCommerce and plugin data
- ✅ Theme files and settings
- ✅ Database content
- ✅ PHP and server settings
- ✅ Configuration and environment

This lets you restore your site at any point without reinstallation or downtime.

## 🎯 When to Use Snapshots

- 💡 Before making major plugin or theme updates
- 🧪 Before testing new custom code
- 🛠 During site migrations or server experiments
- 🔁 Before cloning or duplicating a store
- ✅ After reaching a “perfect state” worth saving

## 📌 Snapshot vs. Backup

| Feature         | Snapshot                                | Backup                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Speed           | Instant save/restore                    | Scheduled or manual                    |
| Use Case        | Testing, rollback, duplication          | Recovery, disaster protection          |
| Includes        | Files, DB, settings, environment        | Files and/or DB only (based on config) |
| Location        | WC Studio internal                      | Backup provider or local               |

You can use **Snapshots + Backups** together for total store protection.
