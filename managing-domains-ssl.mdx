## 🌍 Domain Management

### ✅ Add a Custom Domain

To use your own domain (like `yourstore.com`):

1. Navigate to the **Domains** tab.
2. Click **“Add Domain”**.
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `store.yourbrand.com`).
4. WC Studio will display DNS records (A, CNAME) to add to your domain registrar.

🛠 Once the DNS propagates, your domain will connect to your WC Studio store.

### 🔁 Set a Primary Domain

If you have multiple domains/subdomains:

- Choose one as the **primary domain**.
- WC Studio will automatically redirect all traffic from secondary domains to the primary one.
- This helps with SEO and avoids duplicate content issues.

### 🆓 Default Subdomain

Every store also includes a free subdomain:  
`yourstore.wcstudio.com`

✅ Useful for testing, development, or staging environments.

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Stores → Select a Store → Manage → SSL

## 🔒 SSL Certificate Setup

WC Studio provides **automatic SSL installation** through Let's Encrypt for all domains — no configuration required.

### ✅ Auto SSL Installation
WC Studio automatically installs **SSL certificates** for both subdomains and custom domains via Let's Encrypt.

- No manual configuration is required.
- Certificates are renewed automatically.

💡 **Best Practice:** For better SEO and customer trust, always keep HTTPS forced.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- ✅ Verify DNS records using tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) if propagation is delayed.
- ✅ Use your **free WC Studio subdomain** while setting up your store, then switch to your custom domain later.
- ✅ Always force HTTPS for security, PCI compliance, and trust badges.
