# 🗄️ Accessing Database Credentials

Every store on WC Studio runs on a private, optimized database. While WC Studio manages all backend infrastructure for you, advanced users and developers can access **database credentials** for debugging, external tools, or advanced development purposes.

---

## 📍 Go to: WC Studio → Stores → Select a Store → Manage → Database

---

## 🛠 What You’ll Find in the Database Panel

Once inside the **Database** tab, you’ll see:

### ✅ Database Credentials
- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Host**
- **Port**
- **Connection Type (typically MySQL)**
- **Password** (Click-to-reveal)

💡 **Pro Tip:** You can copy credentials with one click to use in tools like phpMyAdmin, TablePlus, Sequel Ace, or CLI access.

---

### 🔐 Access Policy

- WC Studio encrypts and secures all database credentials.
- Credentials are **read-only by default** unless explicitly given write access.
- You may **regenerate the database password** at any time.

---

## 🔁 Regenerating Database Credentials

To improve security or reset access:

1. Click **"Regenerate Password"**
2. A new secure password will be generated and saved automatically
3. Update your external DB tools if you're using manual access

⚠️ **Warning:** This action will break existing external DB connections until updated.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases for External DB Access

- Manual debugging or inspecting database tables
- Using third-party data visualization tools
- Exporting product or order data via direct queries

✅ All standard WooCommerce tables and any plugin-generated tables are available here.

---

## 🔒 Best Practices

- Only access the database if you **know what you're doing**.
- Always **take a snapshot or backup** before making any structural database changes.
- **Do not share** credentials with unauthorized users.
- Use the **Staging environment** when testing DB-related plugins or custom SQL.
