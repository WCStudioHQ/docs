# 🧩 Understanding Configurations

WC Studio allows you to save reusable sets of store settings — including themes, plugins, PHP limits, and environment options — so you can quickly apply them when launching a new store.

It’s like having a pre-packed launch kit that saves time and keeps your projects consistent.

## 🎯 What is a Configuration?

A **Configuration** is a collection of saved settings and preferences from one store that can be applied to another. This is especially useful for:

- Agencies or freelancers building multiple client stores
- Teams that use consistent setups for different environments (e.g. dev vs live)
- Rapid prototyping of niche store models

---

## 🧰 What Can Be Included in a Configuration?

- ✅ Selected Theme
- ✅ Installed Plugins
- ✅ PHP Settings (limits, execution time, etc.)
- ✅ WooCommerce core settings
- ✅ WordPress General settings
- ✅ Custom values defined at setup

---

## ➕ Creating a New Configuration

1. Go to the **Configurations** panel
2. Click **“Create New Configuration”**
3. Select a source store you want to copy settings from
4. Give your configuration a name and (optional) description
5. Click **Save**

The configuration will be added to your library and ready to apply during future store creation.

## 🧪 Using a Configuration During Store Creation

2. Choose your saved configuration from the dropdown
3. WC Studio will automatically apply your saved:
   - Theme
